Drag me!\n  You can't drag this block now!\n\n\n\n\nResizable\nPlease refer to the demo page.\nBesides of importing AngularDraggableModule, you need to import resizable.min.css in your project. If you use angular-cli, you can add this in angular.json:\n\"styles\": [\n    ...\n+   \"node_modules/angular2-draggable/css/resizable.min.css\"\n]Then you can use ngResizable directive to make the element resizable:\n I'm now resizable \n\n Resizable is disabled now \n\n Each side is resizable Well you can use both directives concurrently if you wish:\n I'm now draggable and resizable API\nDirective:\n\nngDraggable directive support following input porperties:\n\n\n\nInput\nType\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nngDraggable\nboolean\ntrue\nYou can toggle the draggable capability by setting true or false\n\n\nhandle\nHTMLElement\nnull\nUse template variable to refer to the handle element.
